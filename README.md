> ### **Functionality**
This application is very simple to use, it takes basic information about engineers and interns on your team and generates a profile for them with that information.<br>
You are to save your information first, which is: **_name, employee ID, email address and office phone number_**, and after that you can add as many members as there are on your team.<br>
Currently, the app is designed to store team member's **_name, employee ID, email address_** and GitHub profile name for engineers and School name for the interns.<br>
This is the very first release of **Team Tracker**, so our developer is planning to expand functionality and is opened to any suggestions on how to improve the application.
<br/><br/>
> ### **Guide**
Once you've downloaded/cloned the repository on your local machine, run _"node app"_ to start. <br>
You will be prompted with a series of questions to fill in your profile first, make sure to enter valid data but even if you don't, now worries, we've got it covered! <br>
You will be then prompted which member you would to add to add next and there you can make a selection.
Once the information is collected an _"index.html"_ file will be generated in the **dist/** directory and once you load it in your browser you can see the information about the members of your team, including yourself, nicely organized in cards representing each of you.
<br/><br/>
